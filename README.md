## Objectives ðŸ“‹
The primary goal was to develop an AI model to generate accurate price estimates for Airbnb properties based on listing data (e.g., location, number of bedrooms). Another objective was to determine if incorporating sentiment analysis of reviews (positive, negative, neutral) could enhance the model's accuracy.

## Tech Stack ðŸ§°
- Python
- Pandas
- PySpark
- Databricks
- ChatGPT

## Steps taken ðŸªœ
- **Data Collection:** data source was from Airbnb properties in New York City, obtained from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/).<br/>

- **Data Preprocessing:** <br/>

- **Data Sentiment Labeling:** since manual sentiment labeling was tedious and time-consuming, prompted ChatGPT to label the reviews as Position (2), Negative (0), or Neutral (1).<br/>

- **Creating Natural Language Processing Model:** experimented with Machine Learning classification algorithms like Logistic regression (best result), Random forest, and Naive bayes.<br/>

- **Used Natural Language Processing Model to label all the unlabelled reviews:**<br/>

- **Creating Price Prediction Model:** experimented with Machine Learning regression algorithms like Linear regression(best result), Decision Tree, and Gradient boosting(best result).<br/>

- **Fine Tuning of HyperParameters to optimize model performance**<br/>

## Reflection ðŸ¤”
- Painful lesson learned, the first model usually isn't the best, need to iteratively fine-tune hyperparameters over continuous tests!
- Data Cleaning is a very important
- Sentimental Analysis was beneficial to the price prediction model performance
- Need more data
