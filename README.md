## Short Description 📋
The primary goal was to develop an AI model to generate accurate price estimates for Airbnb properties based on listing data (e.g., location, number of bedrooms). Another objective was to determine if incorporating sentiment analysis of reviews (positive, negative, neutral) could enhance the model's accuracy.

## Tech Stack 🧰
- Python
- PySpark
- Databricks

## Steps taken to build this model 🪜
- Data Collection: data source was from Airbnb properties in New York City, obtained from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/)<br/>
  
- Data Preprocessing <br/>

- Data Sentiment Labeling
- Create a Natural Language Processing Model
- Experimented with different Machine Learning algorithms for the price prediction model:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Gradient Boosting
